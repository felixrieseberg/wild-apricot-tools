# wild-apricot-tools
A collection of scripts I use with Wild Apricot.

## Slack Sync
You have a Wild Apricot community with members. You want to sync the list of members with users in a Slack workspace.

This tool will download all members from a Wild Apricot community, compare the email addresses with the users in a Slack workspace, and spit out a report of which Wild Apricot members need to be invited to Slack. It will also download all users from that Slack workspace, see if all of them are paying members in your Wild Apricot community, and spit out a report of which Slack users need to be deactivated.

Because Slack limits fully automated invites to Enterprise plans only, this tool will not automatically invite members. Instead, it'll give you a list of email addresses you can paste into Slack's "Invite users" dialog.

### Usage

```
--wild-apricot-api-key="abc..."     Wild Apricot API Key
--slack-token="xo..."               Slack Bot Token
--start-date="2024-12-31"           Start Date (used with "greater or equal")
--verbose                           Enable verbose mode
```

```
npx wild-apricot-tools slack-sync --wild-apricot-api-key="etwl..." --slack-token="xoxb-..."
```

Then, find a file called `wild-apricot-slack-sync-report.txt` in your working directory. It'll contain a list of people to invite and to deactivate.

## Rename Events
You have a bunch of events. You would like to rename them all.

### Usage

```
--wild-apricot-api-key="abc..."     Wild Apricot API Key
--old-event-name="[Swim]..."        Old Event Name
--new-event-name="[Swim]..."        New Event Name
--dry-run                           Dry run only, only print events to rename
--verbose                           Enable verbose mode
```

```
npx wild-apricot-tools rename-events --start-date="2023-01-01" --wild-apricot-api-key="..." --old-event-name="[Swim] Masters Swim" --new-event-name="[Swim] Garfield Masters Swim"
```

## Clone Event
You have one event. You want it cloned, say, every week for the rest of the year. Uses the current system's time zone.

### Usage

```
--wild-apricot-api-key="abc..."     Wild Apricot API Key
--event-id="123456"                 Id of the event to clone
--schedule="weekly"                 Schedule to use. Only "weekly" is supported.
--end-date="2024-12-25"             End date.
--dry-run                           Dry run only, only print events to create.
--verbose                           Enable verbose mode
```

```
npx wild-apricot-tools rename-events --start-date="2023-01-01" --wild-apricot-api-key="..." --old-event-name="[Swim] Masters Swim" --new-event-name="[Swim] Garfield Masters Swim"
```
